# simple-maze-generator
## Year 3 - Advanced Algorithms

Problem description: "A simple algorithm for maze generation is to start, apart from entry and exit points, with all walls present and randomly knock down walls until the entry and exit points are connected. Write a C++ program to implement this algorithm for an arbitrary sized maze â€“ test with a 50 by 88 rectangular maze."

Note: Paste the output of the program into the text box in the included maze-renderer.html to visualise the generated maze.
